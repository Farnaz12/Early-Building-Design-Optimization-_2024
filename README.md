Dataset: A Comparative Analysis of Random Search and Grid Search Performance for Early Building Design Optimization – An Experimental Study


Abstract 
In the initial phases of architectural design, achieving an optimal balance between precision and computational speed is crucial, given the time and resource constraints inherent in the early stages of a design project. Research in building and architectural design often employs various optimization algorithms, with genetic algorithms (GAs) and their variants demonstrating exceptional performance. However, the computational time required by GAs may limit their practicality for early-stage design evaluations. This study investigates alternative approaches—specifically, random search (RS) and grid search (GS)—as complements to GA for early design assessments. The objective is to streamline and simplify early design evaluations while maintaining a balance between precision and speed in identifying optimal building designs. To validate their applicability, we established a test case using a parametric building model created in Rhino-Grasshopper, with associated energy use as the performance metric simulated using the EnergyPlus software tool. This assessment aims to evaluate the performance of RS and GS algorithms in comparison to a GA approach under a limited computation time. The benchmark for evaluations is derived from a successful long-term run of GA that reached convergence. Our assessment of three optimization methods—RS, GA, and GS—in early-stage building design yields valuable insights. The findings indicate that, if we are limiting the computation timeframe, randomly selecting designs can offer comparable performance in terms of accuracy and computation. A search algorithm with no heuristics, such as RS, can be more efficient. However, it does not guarantee always finding the optimal solutions, as its reliance on extreme randomness introduces the possibility of occasionally failing to find an optimal solution.   To mitigate the impact of randomness, a more systematic approach like GS is suggested to strike a balance between speed and optimality, although, in this experiment, RS demonstrated superior performance to GS. This insight is particularly relevant due to the unique characteristics of the search space in building design optimization. Looking forward, future research could explore additional combinations of search strategies and further investigate the potential of the RS and GS approaches by testing it on larger and more complex building models.
